<blockquote>
This paper presents the SLRA package (http://slra.github.io)---C software with interface to MATLAB, Octave, and R for solving low-rank approximation problems with the following features: mosaic Hankel structured approximating matrix, weighted 2-norm approximation criterion, and fixed and missing elements in the approximating matrix. The package has applications in system identification, machine learning, and computer algebra. The paper gives an overview of the features of the package, including the wrapper functions for system identification (IDENT package) and approximate greatest common divisor (AGCD) computations. The addendum to the paper, available from http://homepages.vub.ac.be/&nbsp;imarkovs/slra-demo, includes examples that demonstrate the usage, versatility, and efficiency of the software.
