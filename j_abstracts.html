<blockquote>
The problem of computing the distance of two real coprime polynomials to the set of polynomials with a nontrivial greatest common divisor (GCD) appears in computer algebra, signal processing, and control theory. It has been studied in the literature under the names approximate common divisor, -GCD, and distance to uncontrollability. Existing solution methods use different types of local optimization methods and require a user defined initial approximation. In this paper, we propose a new method that allows us to include constraints on the coefficients of the polynomials. Moreover, the method proposed in the paper is more robust to the initial approximation than Newton-type optimization methods available in the literature. Our approach consists of two steps: 1) reformulate the problem as the problem of determining the structured distance to singularity of an associated Sylvester matrix, and 2) integrate a system of ordinary differential equations, which describes the gradient associated to the functional to be minimized.

<blockquote>
We present a method to decompose a set of multivariate real polynomials into linear combinations of univariate polynomials in linear forms of the input variables. The method proceeds by collecting the first-order information of the polynomials in a set of sampling points, which is captured by the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the sampling points. The canonical polyadic decomposition of the three-way tensor of Jacobian matrices directly returns the unknown linear relations as well as the necessary information to reconstruct the univariate polynomials. The conditions under which this decoupling procedure works are discussed, and the method is illustrated on several numerical examples.
