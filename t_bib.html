  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of computing the distance from a given linear time-invariant system to the nearest uncontrollable system is posed and solved in the behavioral setting. In the case of a system with two external variables, the problem is restated as a Sylvester structured distance to singularity problem. The structured distance to singularity problem is then solved by integrating a system of ordinary differential equations which describes the gradient associated to the cost functional.
An advantage of the method with respect to other approaches is in its capability to include further constraints. Numerical simulations also show that the method is more robust to the initial approximation than the Newton-type methods.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the SLRA package (http://slra.github.io)---C software with interface to MATLAB, Octave, and R for solving low-rank approximation problems with the following features: mosaic Hankel structured approximating matrix, weighted 2-norm approximation criterion, and fixed and missing elements in the approximating matrix. The package has applications in system identification, machine learning, and computer algebra. The paper gives an overview of the features of the package, including the wrapper functions for system identification (IDENT package) and approximate greatest common divisor (AGCD) computations. The addendum to the paper, available from http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~imarkovs/slra-demo, includes examples that demonstrate the usage, versatility, and efficiency of the software.},

  abstract = {Wiener systems are nonlinear dynamical systems, consisting of a linear dynamical system and a static nonlinear system in a series connection. Existing results for analysis and identification of Wiener systems assume zero initial conditions. In this paper, we consider the response of a Wiener system to initial conditions only, i.e., we consider autonomous Wiener systems. Our main result is a proof that an autonomous Wiener system with a polynomial nonlinearity is equivalent to a finite-dimensional linear system. The order of the equivalent linear system is $(n + d)$-choose-$d$ --- the number of combinations with repetitions of $d$ elements out of $n$ elements --- where $n$ is the order of the linear subsystem and $d$ is the degree of the nonlinearity. The relation between the eigenvalues of the equivalent linear system and the linear subsystem is given by a rank-1 factorization of a symmetric \(d\)-way tensor. As an application of the result, we outline a procedure for identification of autonomous Wiener systems.},

  abstract = {Research shows that, in learning science and engineering, guided project work leads to deeper understanding of theoretical concepts (as well as acquisition of hands-on skills) than the classical approach of textbook reading and attending lectures. In an approach to education based on project work, the role of the teacher is to create a stimulating learning environment and to supervise the students in accomplishing their objectives. The main challenge is to come up with projects that are engaging, diverse, and feasible in view of limited time and resources. In this paper, we describe such a signal processing project. The task is to improve the speed and accuracy characteristics of a sensor by real-time signal processing. It turns out that this is an application of Kalman filtering however the students need to identify a model of the sensor and implement the Kalman filter on a DSP. The project consists of three main tasks: 1) mathematical formalization of the problem, 2) development of solution methods, and 3) implementation and testing of the methods. The testing is done on an inexpensive laboratory setup, using the Lego Mindstorms educational kit in combination with a temperature sensor. The learning outcomes are understanding of model representations, system identification, and state estimation, as well as implementation in Matlab and C of real-time signal processing algorithms. Possible extensions include data fusion of multiple sensors, adaptive signal processing, and applications to other sensors.},

  abstract = {Estimation of a sum-of-damped-exponentials signal from noisy samples of the signal is a classic signal processing problem. It can be solved by maximum likelihood as well as suboptimal subspace methods. In this paper, we consider the related problem of sum-of-exponentials modeling, in which the model is constrained to have no damping. This constraint is difficult to impose in the subspace methods. We develop solution methods using an equivalent Hankel matrix low-rank approximation formulation. A necessary condition for the model to have no damping is that a vector in the kernel of the Hankel matrix has palindromic structure. Imposing this necessary condition in solution methods is trivial. Simulation results show that even for a relatively high noise-to-signal ratios the necessary condition is in fact also sufficient, i.e., the identified model has no dumping. Another contribution of the paper is a method for sum-of-exponentials modeling based on circulant embedding: low-rank approximation of a circulant matrix constructed from the given data. This method imposes the constraint that the model has no damping plus an addition constraint that the model frequencies are on the discrete-Fourier transform's grid.},

  abstract = {Detection and estimation of (approximate) polynomials common factors is an important problem in several fields of science, and it is a still active research topic. While the problem has been widely studied for scalar polynomials, the scientific literature in the framework of matrix polynomials seems to be poor, and it is limimited to the problem of exact greatest common divisors computation. We are going to generalize two algorithms from scalar to matrix polynomials, one fast and simple, the second more accurate but more complicated. We test the performances of the two algorithms to show a behavior similar to the scalar case, and finally we describe an application dealing with MIMO systems.},

  abstract = {Estimation of common dynamics among several observed signals occurs in signal processing, system theory, and computer algebra problems. In this paper, we propose subspace methods for common linear time-invariant dynamics detection and estimation. First, we consider the deterministic problem of detection of common dynamics when the data is exact (noise free). Then, we consider the stochastic estimation problem when the data is corrupted by white Gaussian noise. The methods proposed have a system theoretic interpretation of finding the intersection of autonomous linear time-invariant behaviors. },
