  abstract = {We present a method to decompose a set of multivariate real polynomials into linear combinations of univariate polynomials in linear forms of the input variables. The method proceeds by collecting the first-order information of the polynomials in a set of sampling points, which is captured by the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the sampling points. The canonical polyadic decomposition of the three-way tensor of Jacobian matrices directly returns the unknown linear relations as well as the necessary information to reconstruct the univariate polynomials. The conditions under which this decoupling procedure works are discussed, and the method is illustrated on several numerical examples.},

  abstract = {The problem of computing the distance of two real coprime polynomials to the set of polynomials with a nontrivial greatest common divisor (GCD) appears in computer algebra, signal processing, and control theory. It has been studied in the literature under the names approximate common divisor, $\eps$-GCD, and distance to uncontrollability. Existing solution methods use different types of local optimization methods and require a user defined initial approximation. In this paper, we propose a new method that allows us to include constraints on the coefficients of the polynomials. Moreover, the method proposed in the paper is more robust to the initial approximation than Newton-type optimization methods available in the literature. Our approach consists of two steps: 1) reformulate the problem as the problem of determining the structured distance to singularity of an associated Sylvester matrix, and 2) integrate a system of ordinary differential equations, which describes the gradient associated to the functional to be minimized.},

  abstract = {Computing the greatest common divisor of a set of polynomials is a problem which plays an important role in different fields, such as linear system, control and network theory. In practice, the polynomials are obtained through measurements and computations, so that their coefficients are inexact. This poses the problem of computing an approximate common factor. We propose an improvement and a generalization of the method recently proposed in Guglielmi, N., Markovsky, I.: An ODE based method for computing the distance of coprime polynomials. SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 55, 1456â€“1482 (2017), which restates the problem as a (structured) distance to singularity of the Sylvester matrix. We generalize the algorithm in order to work with more than 2 polynomials and to compute an Approximate GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of degree k > 0; moreover we show that the algorithm becomes faster by replacing the eigenvalues by the singular values.},
